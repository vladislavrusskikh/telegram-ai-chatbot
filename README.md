AI Telegram Bot
An intelligent Telegram chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT models, built with Python and asynchronous programming.

Project Overview
This project is a Telegram bot that leverages OpenAI’s language models (GPT-3.5) to generate human-like responses to user messages. It demonstrates modern Python asynchronous programming using the python-telegram-bot library (v20+) and the official OpenAI Python SDK. The bot provides a natural conversational experience and can be extended for various applications such as customer support, tutoring, or creative writing assistants.

Features
Real-time conversational AI: Responds instantly to user messages with context-aware answers.

Async architecture: Uses asynchronous programming (async/await) for efficient performance.

Environment variable management: Securely loads API keys using .env files.

OpenAI GPT integration: Connects to the latest OpenAI models via official API.

Easy deployment: Simple setup and running instructions.

Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

python-telegram-bot v20+ — Telegram bot framework supporting asyncio

OpenAI Python SDK — Official client for OpenAI API

dotenv — Load environment variables from .env

asyncio — Native Python asynchronous programming

Installation

1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_telegrambot.git
cd ai_telegrambot

2.Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3.Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Create a .env file in the project root
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

5.Run the bot
python bot.py
Usage
Start the bot by sending /start in Telegram.

Send any message to get a response generated by OpenAI GPT.

The bot replies politely and contextually.

Code Highlights

Utilizes the ApplicationBuilder from python-telegram-bot to build and run the bot.
Uses async functions to handle commands and messages efficiently.
Makes asynchronous API calls to OpenAI for chat completions.
Handles API errors gracefully and informs users.
Future Improvements

Add context memory to maintain conversations.
Support multimedia inputs (images, voice).
Deploy on cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
Implement user authentication and logging.

Why This Project?
This project highlights my ability to integrate third-party APIs (OpenAI), manage asynchronous Python programming, and create practical tools with real-world applications. It demonstrates strong coding fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and readiness to work with modern AI technologies.
